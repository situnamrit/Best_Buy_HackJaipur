Best Buy - A Shop App to beat the Pandemic





Ever since the outbreak of a pandemic, we all have faced the situation that maximum shops are opened for a particular time and the rush during any time is at peak. Different people gather Infront of different shops and crowd the area. Here in the application, it sorts out the problem.
The application fills the needs of people. People can register over the app and see different slots available for the same. The slots would be available throughout the day and can be booked in advance. The vendors can list their own shop and the details of everything starting from payments, door-step delivery, and through the application, they can also start accepting peopleâ€™s basket list (what people are going to purchase).
If the vendors know that the people who are coming to the shop what items they are going to purchase, that can already keep the items ready for the same so that the rush in their store reduces to a great extent.
People can also provide the list of articles they need to purchase so that their parcels are ready and they just need to pick it up from the delivery counters of the shop.
There would be vendors who can list items which are open for online delivery and yes, for every small item there cannot be an option for online delivery as it would incur a huge burden. But if customers from the same locality purchase together, then this can be sorted and thing can be delivered right to their door-step.
Through this application, people will definitely get the benefit and would have a great impact on their lives, and it can serve as a good medium to overcome the crowding in the nearest areas.
